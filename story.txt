Today I removed windows from the airstream. 
Windows from 1979 are freaking dirty.
I had no idea I knew how to remove weather stripping and replace it.
But I do.
I wonder how long it will take to finish 8 windows.
Turns out 3 days. 
I continue to work to avoid Dani's wrath.
I will continue to work to learn.
